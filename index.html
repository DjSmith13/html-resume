            <li>Rio Linda High School - High School Diploma</li>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>KMM Logistics & Network Services - Tower Technician</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Date: January 2023 - September 2023</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In this position, I am in a crew with 2-3 other technicians and we 
                    built cell sites and cell towers. I have climbed up in towers that 
                    are as high as 130 feet installing steel structures on the tower for 
                    the radios and antennas that we install to be placed on the steel 
                    brackets and locked in place on the top of the tower. I worked inside 
                    of networking cabinets as well as ran power, landed them in the cabinets, 
                    and routed fiber cables from the ground to the top of the tower effectively. 
                    I’ve used azimuth devices to verify the integrity of the antenna’s alignments 
                    to better maximize the reception and bandwidth of the antennas that are directed 
                    out to the cities we were working in. I’ve supported power cables, power/ fiber 
                    hybrids and stripped them to their components needed to install the cables where 
                    they need to be. I learned how to read the schematics for the infrastructures of 
                    every tower I worked on as well as learned the color codes that were used for cable
                     management. I’ve operated/used Aerial lifts to get me and a crew member up, down, 
                     and all over the towers we worked on. I have a lot of experience working on 
                     T-Mobile and Dish sites.</p>

            <li>Sprout Up - IT Operator / Network Department / 
                Quality Control Specialist </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>June 2022 - January 2023</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I started out scanning cable boxes and routers before throwing them into cardboard bins. 
                    I moved up after a handful of weeks into the network department. In this department, I 
                    worked on networking administration, erasing very sensitive data bearing assets, manipulated/ 
                    reconfigured network infrastructures, as well as checked the market for all of our networking 
                    devices to divide the useless devices from the expensive ones. We did this for a lot of huge 
                    companies that would work alongside us (Confidential to bring up those names). I’ve had multiple 
                    accomplishments from being thanked on the board at the meetings all the way to rising past the 
                    network administration department and up to the top as the facility’s quality control specialist.
                    Being the quality control specialist, I no longer took orders from any supervisors and only my 
                    boss directly. I had hands on 5% of every single different type of device and technology that 
                    went out to our e-commerce team to approve the integrity of the devices that have been worked 
                    on and ready to be sold. From trouble shooting software, opening devices and replacing RAM sticks 
                    and other components inside the devices to keep them running, and going into the scripts for our 
                    dongle devices and changing the network configuration in the scripts in order to prevent anybody 
                    from accessing inside these devices outside of our company LAN WiFi. I even made it far enough to 
                    having zoom calls with the company’s software developers, guiding me into software development and 
                    learning specific coding languages for the company. I was also a huge contribution to the work 
                    instructions for the entire company. I changed and maximized the efficiency of our work flows 
                    production as well as had multiple video call meetings with the company’s engineering specialist and 
                    video chats with other networking departments at the other warehouses in TEXAS and NORTH CAROLINA. I 
                    was very proud of what I did at that company and working in the IT industry has always been an uphill 
                    progression.</p>

            <li>Applied Adhesives - Compunder</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>March 2022 - June 2022</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As a compounder, I used batch sheets with ingredients and the amount of the ingredients measured in pounds 
                    and cooked them in large industrial tanks. We were making Glue products from breakaway glue to bottle cap
                    glue. I operates multiple valves to navigate the tank’s temperatures using steam in order to cook the glue 
                    and product inside of the tanks effectively. We would drop the glue in totes, poly drums, and even fiber drums 
                    to prepare them to be shipped out.</p>

            <li>D&H Distributing - Forklift Operator</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>September 2021 - Febuary 2022</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I was mostly responsbile for general warehouse work. I used the forklift everyday to bring in and out orders, products, and inventory 
                    stock. I specialized in inventory control along with window shipping and receiving. I pulled orders for customers 
                    and huge construction companies and maintained a healthy customer service attitude when interacting with walk in 
                    customers or clients. I boxed and shipped multiple packages for UPS to pick up and I closed down the warehouse every Friday.</p>

            <li>Ron Dupratt Ford - Warehouse Associate</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>May 2021 - November 2022</li>
                </ul>
                <p>My position’s responsibilities were to grab a pick ticket with client’s orders on them, search through the warehouse 
                    for the correct parts, and storing them in its current location to be shipped out to the clients. I’ve also been 
                    trained on shipping and receiving the parts to and from the warehouse as well as being trained on using the company’s 
                    software. One of the accomplishments I have from working here is pulling the most customer lines and pick tickets out 
                    of all the other warehouse associates. Multiple supervisors, including my boss, have told me countless times that I’m 
                    one of the hardest workers to ever work with them.</p>

            <li>United States Army - 13B Cannon Crew Member</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>September 2018 - March 2021</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I’m an artillery cannon crew member. I’ve done a lot of heavy lifting. I supervises or serves as a member of field artillery 
                    cannon section or ammunition section. I have operated high technology cannon artillery weapon systems. Loads and fires 
                    howitzers, sets fuse and charge on a variety of munitions, including high explosive artillery rounds, laser guided projectiles, 
                    scatterable mines, and rocket assisted projectiles. Uses computer generated fire direction data to set the elevation of cannon 
                    tube for loading and firing. I have employed rifles, machine guns, and grenade and rocket launchers in offensive and defensive 
                    operations. I drove and operated heavy and light wheeled trucks and tracked vehicles. I've transported and managed artillery 
                    ammunition. I'd conduct pre maintenance checks and services in the military vehicles to establish stable efficiency for missions 
                    and movements with them. When I was a Private I was placed in a Sergeant position on the gun line because I’ve separated myself 
                    from my peers in a positive and successful way.</p>
